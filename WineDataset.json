Winemaker Laurent Delaunay knows how to get the very best out of the sun-drenched vineyards in the shadow of the Pyrenees. The sun here concentrates the flavours in their grapes to incredible intensity. The wine is then aged in barrel on its lees, giving it a moreish, creamy texture. Expect plenty of lush apricot and peach flavours, with notes of almond and sweet ginger spice. Aromatic Viognier complements spicy foods brilliantly, so try this with chilli prawns with creamy yoghurt.\n\nIn 2022, this wine won an IWC award for the 2020 vintage.",

The plot sits high above sea-level. Grapes here are exposed to concentrated sunlight and cool nights which encourage gradual, slow ripening. The process helps retain the key characteristics of Riesling \u2013 fresh acidity and plenty of citrus. Come harvest time, gentle pressing preserves those natural flavours. The end result is mouthwatering. Dry, crisp and full of lemon, lime and grapefruit. Delicious alongside fresh seafood.",

Winemaking is led by Dale Clarke, who honed his skills in his native Australia and at M. Chapoutier, the Rh\u00f4ne Valley\u2019s leading biodynamic producer \u2013 an influence that has led William and Dale to convert their winery to organic farming. Come harvest time, grape picking begins at 3am to keep the fruit\u2019s freshness intact. Once crafted, a portion of the blend is left to age on its lees, which adds a creamy texture to this impressive wine. It\u2019s a wonderfully aromatic, bone-dry Provence ros\u00e9. Expect plenty of stone-fruit and citrus notes, with standout flavours of peach and grapefruit. It\u2019s silky texture and crisp acidity makes it the perfect choice for goat\u2019s cheese dishes.",

It\u2019s made using the appassimento method, which has been a distinctly northern Italian style of winemaking for centuries. Primo\u2019s winemaker, Alessandro Michelon, was the first outside of Veneto to adopt the method. He realised that Puglia\u2019s sun-drenched, windswept vineyards offer an ideal climate for the process; once grapes are ripe, his team move through the vines, twisting the stem of every other bunch. This stops them from ripening further and allows them to dry in the wind, resulting in a concentrated and complex wine. Just like a Valpolicella, it\u2019s big, plush and velvety, with ripe flavours of cherry, raspberry and redcurrant. A rich, meaty stew makes the perfect partner to its bold, fruity character.",

For extra complexity, the wine spends 18 months maturing in French oak before bottling. If you can resist opening it, it will continue to develop for up to 10 years.

It's a fitting portrait of a winemaker whose approach to traditional fizz is decidedly unconventional. Michel is all about maximum flavour. Pinot Noir grapes are picked late in the harvest for as much aromatic flavour as possible. Michel then uses only the first press of the grapes, guaranteeing freshness. The wine is then aged for a minimum of four years \u2013 far longer than the required 30 months. The result is a ros\u00e9 Champagne which punches well above its price point.  Expect moreish flavours of redcurrant and raspberry. Although it's dry in style, the creamy texture is perfect with fruity puddings.\n\nIn 2022, this wine won an IWC award",

In 2003, there was leftover fruit from some of their best vineyards. So the winemaking team here saw an opportunity to try out a different style of Pinot Noir. They made a wine which was exceptionally fruity - one which was made to drink young. Roaring Meg was born. And it was such a success, they\u2019ve been making it ever since. This is a real favourite of ours. It's packed with red fruity flavours. Raspberry. Red cherry. A hint of spice. Perfect with glazed ham or rustic duck cassoulet.",

This wine is actually made for us by one of the most prestigious winemaking families in Chile, the Arestis. They know how to get the very best peachy, citrussy flavours out of their grapes, while still keeping prices wallet-friendly. The Central Valley, where this wine is from, is cool but has loads of sunshine \u2013 so this is more like a ripe white Bordeaux than a full, tropically fruity Kiwi Sauvignon. The fact is, Chilean wines are just incredible value \u2013 a wine of this quality from another country could cost far more. In our book, that makes it the ideal party wine. It\u2019s got a real citrussy zing and great tropical flavours. It\u2019s incredibly refreshing, so your guests will be happy to drink it alone, or with finger foods. It\u2019s hard working bottle which won\u2019t disappoint.",

There's even a statue in his memory. And this wine lives up to his name. It's made with grapes from certified sustainable vineyards, and there\u2019s no compromise on quality. Every vintage has only one bottling, with the wine left on its spent yeast cells (or \u2018lees\u2019) to concentrate the flavours and add texture.

His estate is now not just a household name, but New Zealand\u2019s most-awarded winery. Sauvignon Blanc lovers will know that New Zealand is the place to go for wines with mouth-watering freshness. But the true potential of new grape varieties grown here are just being discovered. Albari\u00f1o is fairly new to Villa Maria\u2019s repertoire, but it thrives in Gisborne\u2019s sunshine. More importantly, the region\u2019s cool nights mean that the grapes retain their acidity, giving it delicious crisp and refreshing flavours. It has fresh, zingy flavours of lime, peach, apricot and honeysuckle that are ideal with seafood served with a squeeze of lemon.",

In 1949, under the Soviet Union regime, the Lucas\u2019 vineyards were nationalised and the whole of their family were deported to a Siberian labour camp. After several years, part of the family managed to return to the winery. And today, almost sixty years on, the Carpe Diem estate is thriving. While the Soviet threat has returned \u2013 with the winery pausing operations to aid their Ukrainian neighbours \u2013 their wines continue to go from strength to strength. Crafted from an indigenous variety, Feteasca Alba, this dry white has crisp notes of jasmine, white peach and newly cut grass. It\u2019s light and fresh \u2013 perfect for serving as an ap\u00e9ritif or with soft cheeses.",

His inherited love of the land led him to study viticulture, and since 1998, along with the help of his brother Pascal, he makes wines combining traditional and modern practices. Their vines have an average age of 25 years, allowing grapes to ripen with greater complexity, and their minimal intervention approach means the resulting wines have deliciously pure fruity flavour. This has aromatic notes of citrus, blackcurrant leaf and gooseberry. The finish is elegant and long with hints of flinty minerality and ripe apple. Its crisp and zingy character makes it a great choice for a goat\u2019s cheese and apple salad.",

Madame Clicquot's innovative thinking saw her invent winemaking techniques that are still used in Champagne today. So it's no wonder her influence earned her the title of 'La Grande Dame de la Champagne'. This Pinot Noir-dominant cuv\u00e9e was created in 1972 to honour the 'Great Lady' \u2013 and to also celebrate the bicentenary of the house. Madame Clicquot believed that Pinot Noir had the broadest range of expression and potential to create the best Champagnes. Veuve's current cellar master, Didier Mariotti, wholeheartedly agrees and the grape now accounts for up to 90 percent of the blend. He sums up this prestigious wine as  \u2018structured and textured\u2019. With such exquisite flavour and complexity, we\u2019re certain you\u2019ll find popping its cork a memorable event. Expect fine bubbles that are delicately creamy, with lively notes of ripe lemon, rye bread and a hint of smokiness. Its incredibly fresh, making every sip mouthwatering. Italian artist and ceramicist Paola Paronetto is behind the label and packaging design of the 2015 vintage. Her love of colour is reflected in the vast array of eye-catching cases.

The winery is very much a family affair, led by brothers Jean-Fernand and Fran\u00e7ois Thibault. Their winemaking journey began in 1991 with the discovery of some abandoned southwest-facing vineyards. Decades on, Jean-Fernand\u2019s sons and nephew now make up the team, having gained a wealth of winemaking experience from around the world, ranging from South America to neighbouring Sancerre. This Sauvignon has previously received high praise from Decanter, and as of the 2022 vintage, the winery will be officially certified as organic. It\u2019s lively and aromatic, with notes of white peach, pear and a touch of mint. Expect flavours of orange zest and orchard fruit, plus a streak of chalky minerality reminiscent of Pouilly-Fum\u00e9. Plenty of freshness makes it a wonderful match for seafood dishes.",

A benchmark for quality, they're celebrated for having pioneered many of this Western Australian wine region's renowned styles. Despite other grape varieties often taking the limelight, Shiraz really flourishes here. A cooler coastal influence results in a more restrained style than the bold-and-jammy Shiraz of Barossa and Mclaren Vale. In a nod towards the traditional Syrah blends of the Rh\u00f4ne Valley's C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie, winemaker Eloise Jarvis blends her red Shiraz grapes with white Viognier to dial up the complexity. Viognier is rich and aromatic, so adding it to a blend brings freshness, softens tannins, and enhances any fruity and floral notes. C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie wines usually come with lofty prices, but this Cape Mentelle favourite means you can enjoy the style at a fraction of the cost. Expect a complex and structured wine with layers of violets, dark forest fruits and wild cherries. Intense savoury notes of tobacco, leather and spice mean this wine matches well with simple grilled meats or rich vegetable-laden stews.",

But their expertise goes beyond their world-famous reds. Their delicious Cava has all the character and complexity to rival some of the finest Champagnes. Made in the traditional method, it undergoes a slow and lengthy secondary fermentation over 3-4 months. And this patience results in the perfect balance between flavour and finely textured bubbles. A blend of native Viura and Chardonnay, it\u2019s a complex and textured reminder of why Cava is enjoying such a forceful resurgence in popularity.

        "Description":"Despite the label, you can consider this bottle to be a Chianti Rufina Reserva DOCG \u2013 Chianti\u2019s most northerly subzone \u2013 and the area renowned for making the region\u2019s most long lived wines. Sat in the foothills of the Apennine mountains, vines here benefit from warm sunny days followed by cool nights. The huge changes in temperature results in wines with intense aromas and plenty of fresh acidity \u2013 and it\u2019s this acidity that gives them their lengthy ageing potential. Due to a change in production rules in the 1980s, the prestigious Grato family can\u2019t label this bottling a Chianti Rufina. They keep back some of their best cuv\u00e9es, ageing them for longer than the DOCG panel allows. It means they become what's known as a declassified wine, but don\u2019t let that fool you into thinking this is anything less than a first-rate Tuscan red. Predominantly Sangiovese, the blend spent 30 months in oak barrels, followed by further ageing in tank and bottle before release. Discover intense notes of ripe black cherry and forest floor, with hints of cinnamon spice and leather. It has a silky and savoury character with mellowed tannins, making it a delicious choice for roasted game.",

Back when the farm started over 150 years ago, there were no chemicals involved in keeping vines healthy. So that\u2019s why, in 2000, they switched to fully organic, biodynamic practices. Their wines have since won countless awards, and in 2020 they were described as one of South Africa\u2019s \u2018First Growth\u2019 wineries by top critic Tim Atkin MW. This juicy red is a brilliant demonstration of their skill. Part of the wine spends eight months in oak, making it smooth and approachable.

In 2012, he took over his father's 13 hectares of Chenin Blanc (with vines up to 65 years old) and has never looked back.

It\u2019s one of New Zealand\u2019s lesser-known wine regions and widely credited as New Zealand\u2019s sunniest spot with an average of over 2400 hours of sunshine annually. This means perfectly-ripe grapes with plenty of freshness. 100% sustainably-farmed Pinot Noir grapes are gently pressed to release the premium free-run juice and spend only a short while on their skins. The result? A delicate platinum pink colour and vibrant fruit flavours. Expect ripe flavours of raspberry, strawberries, cherry and notes of jasmine. Perfect as an ap\u00e9ritif, with nibbles and, of course, strawberries and cream.",
